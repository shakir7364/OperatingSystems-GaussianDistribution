# Operating Systems Gaussian Distribution Assignment
This is a simple assignment on Gaussian Distribution. A quick for loop is used to increment variables that track the generated values from the Random class's nextGaussian() method. These variables are supposed to match the percentages of a Gaussian Distribution curve. After running the program, we can see that this is the case.

I have also included a sample output text file named SampleOutput.txt. You'll want to scroll down to the bottom of this output for the important information. The Java files are located under GaussianDistribution/src/guassianDistribution folder.

I completed this assignment using Eclipse and have exported the project as an Eclipse archive zip file. To run the project yourself, simply import the archive named GaussianDistribution.zip into your workspace using Eclipse.
